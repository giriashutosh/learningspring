1. creation of object and passing it to the another object as a dependency is little bit
   hectic task for multiple objects. to resolve this issue we have the spring container or
   spring framework support. with the help of @Configuration annotated file and includes
   @Bean objects. create application context also.
2. If there are multiple beans with the same name then use the @Primary and @Qualifier
   annotation.
3. POJO vs Java Bean vs Spring Bean
4. In Bean also we are creating the object manually and auto-wiring it to resolve this issue
   we use @Component annotation on a class for which spring will create/manage the object and
   use @ComponentScan to find the path of the component classes for spring.
5. @Primary - bean should be given preferences when multiple candidates qualified.
   @Qualifier - bean should be auto-wired (which name has been specifically mention)
6. Dependency Injection Type - Constructor-based, setter-based, Field
7. @Autowired - Field Injection
8. Setter method- Set Injection
9. create constructor - Constructor Injection @Autowired is not mandatory
